Creators: Maya Garcia, Jessica Ju, Tia Mbabazi

Description: Help! There is an astronaut, named JTM.  JTM got lost in space, oh no! Please help JTM navigate through space. She must avoid the rock pillars because 
she'll lose lives. If she loses all her lives, she'll be lost in space forever! If you let JTM hit the floor, she will face serious injuries and die. Watch Out!! 
Don't let the aliens attack JTM because they can capture her! Try to get to the planets on top of the pillars while floating through space to earn extra points.
Help JTM capture the planets for extra points because the aliens could be sneaky and steal them! If the aliens beat JTM to a planet then she'll lose points.

Please enjoy our fun Space Theme game and help JTM navigate through space! 

Press the start button in the upper right corner to start the game. Continue pressing the start button to make the astronaut float upwards. You will start with 3 lives
and 0 points, which is indicated in the textbox to the upper left corner. The main premise of the game is to get the astronaut to float through the rock pillars 
without touching them. Each pillar she floats through successfully will give you a point increase. If the astronaut touches the rock pillar, you will lose a life. 
When you lose all 3 lives, the game will be over. However, when the astronaut touches either the floor or aliens, the game will be over immediately. Furthermore, if 
the alien touches the planet, there is a deduction of 3 points. When the astronaut touches the planet, you will gain 3 more points.
